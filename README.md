# Hello, I'm Abhay 👋
I am your friendly neighborhood web developer, just another 22 year old geek who likes to build cool stuff on the internet by turning coffee into code, and making pixels and words dance together.

Currently, I'm a freelance ninja, slicing through projects with precision and style. Whether you're looking for a long-term partner or just a quick fling with some code, I'm your guy.
Fun fact : do you know that spiders are the only web developers that are happy to find bugs.
